#Next Word Predictor using LSTM and TensorFlow
This project implements a Next Word Predictor using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks with TensorFlow and Keras. Given a sequence of words, the model predicts the next word in the sequence.

**Project Structure**

next_word_predictor.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for training the LSTM model and generating predictions.
README.md: This file, providing an overview, usage instructions, and other relevant information.

**Getting Started**

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

TensorFlow
NumPy

**Usage**

Open the next_word_predictor.ipynb notebook.
Run the cells to train the LSTM model and generate predictions.
Modify the text variable to change the input sequence for prediction.

**Acknowledgments**

This project was inspired by the concept of language modeling and LSTM networks.
